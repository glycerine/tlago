# Java SANY Test Port

This directory contains the Go porting surface for the Java SANY tests from:

`tlaplus/tlatools/org.lamport.tlatools/test/tla2sany`

Fixtures and corpus inputs are mirrored under `sany_tests/test_vectors/tla2sany/`.
Do not use a `testdata/` directory here; local cleanup/fuzzer workflows may
delete it.

Each Java `@Test` method should have a corresponding Go test in this directory.
Keep translated assertions faithful to the Java source, and add any copied
fixtures under `sany_tests/test_vectors/` instead of relying on external checkout
locations.
